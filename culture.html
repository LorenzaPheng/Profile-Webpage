  <p class="short">I'm from a Cambodian family, and my parents are Buddhists. Even though I was born in Bangkok, Thailand, my family moved to New Zealand soon after I was born. Despite growing up here, I still feel a strong tie to Cambodia and its culture. My upbringing has taught me to appreciate my Cambodian roots, and I hold onto the traditions and values that are part of my heritage. New Zealand is where I live now, but Cambodia will always be a big part of who I am, shaping how I see the world and my place in it.</p>
